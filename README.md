## Motivation

Working as a frontend developer showed me some cool tools to use to understand how the components should behave. One of them was **Storybook**.

To understand how to use **Storybook** I decided to make a "design system" (with a single button and some variations) to understand how this tool works and can help us, developers, to write our code in the daily basis.

## Results

To see the outcome of this project you can:

-   Clone the repo
-   Install dependencies
-   Run `npm run storybook`

## Other

Something that I would like to do with this is publish as a `npm` package. I tried but couldn't have something working.
